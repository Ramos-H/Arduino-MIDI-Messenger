# Arduino MIDI Messenger
A C# WPF program that takes serial output from the Arduino and reroutes it to a virtual MIDI port for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). Made for 11th Grade Research Project.
Requires Tobias Erichsen's virtualMIDI driver for it to work. (https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/virtualmidi.html)
